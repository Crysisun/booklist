# Booklist
This is a simple booklist web application building with React and Redux.
## Getting Started
I used the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to initialize this app.
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the Node.js installed, after you install the Node, NPM will also be included.
### Clone 
```
git clone https://github.com/Crysisun/booklist.git
```
### Run the app
```
cd booklist
npm start
```
* Open the client at http://localhost:3000/
* The web app will show up, there are some hard coded books on booklist and you can select them to get the details of those books.
## Built with
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
